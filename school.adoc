== School

I entered the Honours Computer Science Co-Op program at
link:http://mcmaster.ca[McMaster University] in Fall 2010. My original
graduation date would have been April 2014; however, due to my long-term
internship at Red Hat, this has been delayed by one year. I'm on track
to complete my Bachelor's of Applied Science, Computer Science degree
in the Spring of 2015, with two advanced graduate level credits already
completed, and having earned the Louis J. Shein scholarship for "academic
excellence in Russian Language course" after first year.
