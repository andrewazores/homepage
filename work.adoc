== Work

I am currently on a 16 month internship with Red Hat in Toronto, working as a
member of the OpenJDK team. Most of my time is spent contributing to
link:http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/IcedTea-Web[IcedTea-Web], but I do
occasionally work on other things, such as
link:http://github.com/devoxx4kids/materials[Devoxx4kids]. Devoxx is a large
developers' conference in Europe, and my contribution to this project revolves
around helping to develop a curriculum which can be used by Devoxx organizers
to introduce school children to programming, using the ubiquituous Java
platform to do so.
